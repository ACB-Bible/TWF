<h3 align="center">Twenty-First Century Version(TWF)</h3>

The "Twenty-First Century Version" is part of the "Bible Code Project". It's a new version of the bible that's being translated and paraphrased from many different ancient scriptures including the "King James Version". It's being rewritten by humans, with the help of AI or Artificial Intelligence. There are many books and chapters in need of translating.  The verses from the TWF.db database will be imported into the BibleDB.db file in the "BibleDB Project" which is another part of the "Bible Code Project".

The books and chapters in the tables below have been partially edited. Google "Bard" and Microsoft "Bing Copilot" AI engines are being used to help with the translation. The original verses in the TWF.db file came from the "King James Version". They've already been substantially edited by computer algorythms, but need extensive human re-editing. The TWF.db can be edited with the "DB Browser" database Graphical User Interface. The instructions for downloading and installing it is in the "Bible Code Project" documentation link below.
