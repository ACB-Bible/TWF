The "Twenty-First Century Version" of the bible is a new paraphrased Bible version that is actively being worked on. It's being translated from many different ancient text sources. The paraphrased translation is being rewritten by humans with human oversight, with the help of AI Artificial Intelligence. There are many books and chapters that are in need of translation and paraphrasing. If you would like to contribute to this effort, please fork this project. The only files that will be used for translating and paraphrasing will be the TWF.db file in the TWF folder.

The TWF.db database file can be edited with "DB Browser for SQLite" for Windows which is explained on the <a href="../../Readme.md">Readme.md</a> page in the main folder, or you can use the command line, if that's more comfortable for you.

These are the books and chapters that are in the rough draft stage so far, they are in need of final editing for grammar and spelling. All other books and chapters are in need of complete translation and paraphrasing verse by verse. I am using Google Bard and Bing ChatGPT to help with the translation for these verses. The original verses in the TWF.db file come from the "King James Version," but they have already been substantially edited by computer algorythms, and in many cases this has made the verse incoherent. So these verses have to be edited double checked along with paraphrasing and translated from archaic English.

##### Edited and Pararphrased to Rough Draft:
The Chapters column in the table below indicates which chapter and verses have been edited. Such as Genesis - Rough Draft means that the book of Genesis has been completely edited to the rough draft stage. Numbers - 2:5 means that in the book of Numbers, chapter 1 has been completely edited to the rough draft stage, and chapter 2 has been edited through verse 5. Revelation 6:1 means chapter 1-5 in the book of Revelation have been edited, and editing should begin with chapter 6 - verse 1. All the other books and chapters are in need of editing.
